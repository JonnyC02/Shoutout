The user must also be 25% louder than the media to skip the video completely.

### Compile
If you're on windows run 

`yarn compile:win`

If you're on mac run

`yarn compile:mac`

The built executable will be placed in the ./build folder in the project root

### Development

`yarn dev`

This will build and open the version of the code you currently have
